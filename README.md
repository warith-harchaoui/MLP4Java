# MLP4Java

MLP4Java implements a Multi Layer Perceptron (Neural Network) for Java with Linear, Relu, Sigmoid and Softmax activation functions with SGD and Adadelta training.

**Today, this project is obsolete.**

Nowadays, a good way to get a Neural Network is first to prototype it in Python with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), second to save the resulting neural network in a [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format and third, load it back in the language of your choice. [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) Apache project provides a wide variety of supported languages.
